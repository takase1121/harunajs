The ShipGirl Project. Haruna, the helping hand of Kashima. `(c) Kancolle for Haruna.`

Simple webhook vote handler for [Discord Bot List](https://discordbots.org/) to help with [Kashima](https://discordbots.org/bot/424137718961012737)

This API / webhook handler is ~~oversimplified~~ simple to use. As long as you can start it, it will handle everything for you to save you the hassle of creating your own vote handler.

### Why Haruna?

> Fast and reliable.

> Standalone and does not require the bot to be running on the same process.

> Automatic Management of Votes, haha yes you don't even need to do anything other than to configure this.

> Really cute girl OWO.

> And above of all, Haruna is a waifu material.

### Now more easier to host
> Now even comes with [`server.js`](https://github.com/deivu/haruna/blob/master/server.js), all you need to run to have your vote handler ready! (after you configured your settings)

> Just copy the repo and put it on your server, then start server.js after you configured the config files, ain't that easy?

> Configuration Files Examples is at config_examples folder of this repo. Drag one of those to the server.js directory, and fill it up with the needed settings.

## Support
**We provide support for usage of this API in our Official Server [in HERE](https://discordapp.com/invite/FVqbtGu)**

Ask on **#Bot-Support** channel and make sure you indicate support for this API.


## Notes
* You might want to run Haruna with [`pm2`](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or native services so any unexpected restarts will be handled and better logging
* This is a standalone API, so as long as the parent process is alive, disconnections should be handled automatically.
